  # Faux Scrolling
  #
  # The `faux_multiplier` setting controls the number
  # of lines the terminal should scroll when the alternate
  # screen buffer is active. This is used to allow mouse
  # scrolling for applications like `man`.
  #
  # To disable this completely, set `faux_multiplier` to 0.
